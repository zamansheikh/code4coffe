ptr = fopen("c:/Users/filename.txt","w");
ptr = fopen("c:/Users/filename.txt","a");
ptr = fopen("c:/Users/filename.bin","wb");
ptr = fopen("c:/Users/filename.bin","rb");


fie Opening Mode

r - read
w - write
a - append


reading a file
fscanf(ptr,"%s",&variable);
fscanf(ptr,"%d",&variable);
fscanf(ptr,"%f",&variable);
fscanf(ptr,"%lf",&variable);

print
fprintf(ptr,"%s",variable);
fprintf(ptr,"%d",variable);
fprintf(ptr,"%f",variable);
